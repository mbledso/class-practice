I was trying to tell git who I was and I couldn't figure out if it worked or not because nothing would appear to confirm it.

I am still unsure how to edit files located on my repository (for example my  README.md). The chapter talks a lot about how to see where changes are made.

This chapter has a lot of useful information that I will probably go back and reference a lot when working with git. First I am going to have to figure out how to add this file into my repository.
